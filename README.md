Hello, user! In the auto-runner game "Sweet Teeth," you play as caries trying to rot as many teeth as possible in the mouth! You achieve this using your superpower, teleportation. Be careful not to fall off the rows of teeth while teleporting, as your power automatically teleports you every second but only within the radius. You can control this with your mouse. Additionally, a furious toothbrush relentlessly chases you, aiming to stop you. If you touch it, you die. But it gets even more challenging, as angry mouthwashes and toothpastes stand in your way, and they can also be deadly! Stay alert! To aid your progress, you can collect candies that give you even more power. Once you've collected 5 candies, you can instantly destroy all teeth within your radius for a specific duration. This will help you achieve the highest possible score! The table in the bottom left corner of the screen always keeps you informed about how many teeth you've destroyed and how many candies you need in order to regain your extra power. At the end of the game, you'll see a flag marking the end of your marathon through the mouth, revealing your score. If you're motivated to improve your score, simply try again by hovering over the play button with your mouse for a few seconds, and the race for the sweet teeth continues! 

Have fun with your sugar rush.



## Basic Mechanics

Using mouse movement, caries can teleport. It doesn't require a click or an additional button; simply hovering the mouse in the desired direction automatically teleports caries to that location every 1.5 seconds, determined by the size of the radius.

So, mice, get set, and let the teleportation begin!



## Art Style & Setting

As mentioned in the game description, the main character "Caries" is situated in a mouth. Blue and pink veins are in the background, while the green bacterium teleports automatically between rows of teeth within its radius every second. The radical destruction of the teeth causes them to rot and turn black. The colorful candies on the path shine temptingly and the deadly toothbrush is constantly brushing up and down. In our game's color scheme, we find blue tones for the enemies, and although much is already pink in the mouth, the pink, violet-yellow candies stand out exceptionally. All sprites were individually drawn in Adobe Illustrator on iPad and Mac, in a comic style with many highlights and outlines by the designers. The game was developed in Unity by the programmers.
